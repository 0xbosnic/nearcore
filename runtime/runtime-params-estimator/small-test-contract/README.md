# Small test contract

Contract implemented on Rust for estimating base contract deployment cost. 

We needed such a restore, because these receipts got stuck in chain due to a bug fixed by a `FixApplyChunks` protocol upgrade. See [#4248](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/4248) for more details.

## Requirements

Mainnet archival node dump.
